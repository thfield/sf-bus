    Data is derived from sfmta gtfs feed as of 2017-02-25. I in no way confirmed that these routes are accurate. In fact, I have since noticed some irregularities in how the paths are chosen: sometimes a weekend or late night route is mistakenly chosen as "representative" of the bus route in general.
